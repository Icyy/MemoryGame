# MemoryGame
I made a simple game using HTML, CSS, JS. This will test your memory retention skill. 

How to play - 

A color tile will be flashed try to remember which color flashed and then click it, then a new color will be flashed now you'll have to click the first tile and then the new tile after it, this will continue until you get it wrong. 
If you get the wrong pattern game will be over.
