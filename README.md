# MemoryGame
I made a simple game using HTML, CSS, JS. This will test your memory retention skill. 

How to play - 
A color tile will flash try to remember which color flashed and then click it, then a new color will be flashed now you'll have to click the first tile and then the new tile as well.
If you get the wrong pattern game will be over.
